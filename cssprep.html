In nth of type the group of siblings is considered no matter how many type of elemenets created before that but if we give the number to that particular tag it will count its siblings only

p:nth-of-type(3) {
  background: red;
}
</style>
</head>                              THE ELEMENT WILL BE PARA 3RD 
<body>
<span>The first paragraph.</span>
<span>The first paragraph.</span>
<p>The first paragraph.</p>
<p>The first paragraph.</p>
<p>The first paragraph.</p>
<p>The second paragraph.</p>
<p>The third paragraph.</p>
<p>The fourth paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
In nth of child there is no sibling concept instead it counts head of the given property

15. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RELATIVE, FIXED, ABSOLUTE AND STATICALLY POSITIONED ELEMENT?
Ans.
Statical……………………….	Relative……………………..	Fixed…………………………..	Absolute…………………….

Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
This element is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.
It is positioned relative to its normal position. 
 top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
Is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.
A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.
Notice the fixed element in the lower-right corner of the page. Here is the CSS that is used:

It  is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
